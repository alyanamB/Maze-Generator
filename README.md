# Maze-Generator
This C++ program generates a randomized maze using a depth-first search algorithm. The maze is represented as a grid with walls represented by numbers, and the output is saved to a file.

## Features
- Generates a random maze bazed on input dimensions.
- Uses depth-first search (DFS) with backtracking to carve paths.
- Allows custom seed input for reproducibility.
- Saves the generated maze to a specified output file.
